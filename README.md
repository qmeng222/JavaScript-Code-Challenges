# Code Challenges

## About:

Get ready to set off on a wild journey filled with thrilling problem-solving challenges by my side! ðŸ‘¾ðŸŽ®
With this repository, I'll tackle real-world challenges like setting up a ticking clock in a document, filtering vegetarian dinner options from a menu, and calculating the bill from a trip to a coffee shop. Each challenge is its own exciting quest, giving me the chance to sharpen my JavaScript skills one step at a time!

## Three ways to run tests:

1. navigate to the file directory, type "node fileName.js" in the terminal and press enter
2. or go to the Run option in the VS Code menu and select Run Code
3. or install the Code Runner extension to easily run JS code

## Notes:

Check each challenge session for reference.
